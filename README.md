- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dompaon
Im interested in all that is linked to MIDI stuff and programming, abd always lookin for developpers to share my ideas with.
Although I use to code when I was younger (Im 55), Im not in todays dev tools and I cant do modern object coding.
Ive got plenty of specs for MIDI projects, related to sequencing, chord analysing , fancy gears driving etc....
If any developper is lookin for ideas and has time to spend, I can fill his lonely days with wishes !
